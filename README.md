**Indian Air Quality Prediction**

This repository contains code and documentation for a machine learning model designed to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) in various regions across India. The model utilizes historical data from different cities in India, integrating diverse machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, k-Nearest Neighbors regression, decision tree regression, support vector regression, and random forest regression.

**Features:**
- Data Collection and Preprocessing: Includes steps for obtaining and preprocessing air quality dataset from Kaggle, eliminating irrelevant attributes, handling null values, and scaling features.
- Visualization: Visual representations of dataset attributes, city instances, and pollutant concentrations across different areas.
- AQI Calculation: Explanation of the methodology for calculating AQI based on pollutant concentrations.
- Model Training and Testing: Details on training machine learning models using random sampling and evaluating their performance.
- Workflow of the Models: Flowchart illustrating the proposed methodology for air quality prediction.
- Machine Learning Models: Overview and implementation of linear regression, k-Nearest Neighbors regression, decision tree regression, support vector regression, and random forest regression models.
- Results: Summary of model evaluation metrics and comparison of different regression models.
